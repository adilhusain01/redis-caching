### Cache Layers: I studied how caching reduces database load by keeping frequently accessed data in memory, acting as an extra layer to speed up response times.

## Using Redis as a caching layer in Node.js taught me how to integrate Redis with Node.js, manage Redis connections, and deal with connection errors.

### Cache-First Pattern: The cache-first pattern, which optimizes efficiency by limiting database queries, is introduced by putting the logic in place to check the cache before querying the database.

### Cache Expiration and Data Freshness: Learned how to balance cache freshness and performance by establishing an expiration time (TTL). This entails determining the optimal TTL for your data by considering its frequency of change.
